# random-quote-generator

## Overview

This is a simple SPA written in VueJS to generate a random quote.
It uses the "Quote Garden" API to generate the quote.
A user could also click on the name of the author of the quote to get a list of quotes from that author.
This app also uses Vue-Router to seperate the random quote generator and the author quotes.
